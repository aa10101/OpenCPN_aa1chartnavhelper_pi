"Created(/Assembled) by Andras A. - Chart Nav Helper, \n"
"This plugin adds a compass rose and rulers on the viewed map - \n"
"The compass rose and ruler will appear on the printed maps also, and by this "
"it \n"
"will make the printed maps useful in manual navigation -\n"
"\n"
"It is based on code from The World Magnetic Model Plugin which was written by "
"Pavel Kalian and extended by Sean D'Epagnier, and some other OpenCPN code "
"segments from various parts of the code base.\n"
"\n"
"This plugin uses the WMM plugin to get information about variation at the "
"center of the compass rose.  \n"
"It has a configuration dialog where the year at which the variation is "
"expected to be calculated can be set.\n"
"The variation can be set to a fixed value (unfortunately the user provided "
"variation value was not accessible by this plugin)\n"
"\n"
"NOTES: The intent for building this plugin was to help the training and "
"practice of navigation skills at USPS.\n"
"(The compass rose can be moved by the mouse by dragging it at the center of "
"the compass rose) "
